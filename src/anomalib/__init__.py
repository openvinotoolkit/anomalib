"""Anomalib library for research and benchmarking.

This library provides tools and utilities for anomaly detection research and
benchmarking. The key components include:

    - Multiple state-of-the-art anomaly detection models
    - Standardized training and evaluation pipelines
    - Support for various data formats and tasks
    - Visualization and analysis tools
    - Benchmarking utilities

Example:
    >>> from anomalib.models import Padim
    >>> # Create and train model
    >>> model = Padim()
    >>> model.train(train_dataloader)
    >>> # Generate predictions
    >>> predictions = model.predict(test_dataloader)

The library supports:
    - Classification and segmentation tasks
    - One-class, zero-shot, and few-shot learning
    - Multiple input formats (images, videos)
    - Custom dataset integration
    - Extensive configuration options

Note:
    The library is designed for both research and production use cases,
    with a focus on reproducibility and ease of use.

    This enum defines the different learning paradigms supported by anomalib models:

        - ``ZERO_SHOT``: Model learns without any task-specific training samples
        - ``FEW_SHOT``: Model learns from a small number of training samples

# Release Candidate Process Workflow
#
# This reusable workflow implements a comprehensive release candidate (RC) process
# with multiple validation stages and approvals.
#
# Key Features:
# - Multi-stage validation
# - Technical review process
# - QA validation steps
# - Product review integration
# - Approval tracking
#
# Process Stages:
# 1. Technical Review:
#    - Test PyPI deployment
#    - Build validation
#    - Security verification
#
# 2. QA Validation:
#    - Test results review
#    - Deployment verification
#    - Documentation check
#
# 3. Product Review:
#    - Feature verification
#    - Release notes review
#    - Version compatibility
#
# 4. Final Approval:
#    - Sign-off collection
#    - Approval recording
#    - Release readiness
#
# Required Inputs:
# - version: Version to release
# - artifact-name: Name of build artifact
#
# Required Secrets:
# - test-pypi-token: PyPI token for test deployments
#
# Example Usage:
# 1. Standard RC Process:
#    jobs:
#      rc-release:
#        uses: ./.github/workflows/_reusable-rc-release-process.yaml
#        with:
#          version: "v1.2.3-rc1"
#          artifact-name: "dist-123456789"
#        secrets:
#          test-pypi-token: ${{ secrets.TEST_PYPI_TOKEN }}
#
# Note: Requires configured environments with appropriate approvals

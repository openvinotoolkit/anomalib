# Code Quality Workflow
#
# This reusable workflow executes code quality checks using pre-commit hooks
# and other quality assurance tools across multiple languages.
#
# Key Features:
# - Pre-commit hook execution
# - Multi-language support
# - Dependency caching
# - Configurable environments
# - Parallel check execution
#
# Process Stages:
# 1. Environment Preparation:
#    - Python setup
#    - Cache configuration
#
# 2. Quality Checks:
#    - Code linting
#    - Style verification
#    - Type checking
#    - Best practices validation
#
# 3. Results Processing:
#    - Error reporting
#    - Check summaries
#    - Status updates
#
# Required Inputs:
# - python-version: Python version for checks (default: "3.10")
#
# Example Usage:
# 1. Default Configuration:
#    jobs:
#      quality:
#        uses: ./.github/workflows/_reusable-code-quality.yaml
#
# 2. Custom Versions:
#    jobs:
#      quality:
#        uses: ./.github/workflows/_reusable-code-quality.yaml
#        with:
#          python-version: "3.11"
#
# Note: Requires configured pre-commit hooks in repository

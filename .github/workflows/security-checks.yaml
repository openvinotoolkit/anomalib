# Security Checks Workflow
#
# This workflow orchestrates comprehensive security scanning using multiple tools and
# configurable parameters. It supports both scheduled and manual execution modes.
#
# Key Features:
# - Multiple security tool integration
# - Scheduled daily scans
# - Manual trigger with customization
# - Configurable severity thresholds
# - Flexible scan scope options
#
# Process Stages:
# 1. Scheduled Execution (Daily at 2 AM UTC):
#    - Full security toolset
#    - Complete codebase scan
#    - LOW severity threshold
#
# 2. Manual Execution:
#    - Selectable security tools
#    - Adjustable scan scope
#    - Customizable severity level
#
# Security Tools:
# - Bandit: Python-specific security scanning
# - ClamAV: Malware detection
# - Semgrep: Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
# - Trivy: Vulnerability scanning
#
# Required Permissions:
# - contents: read
# - security-events: write
#
# Example Usage:
# 1. Scheduled Run:
#    Automatically runs with full configuration
#
# 2. Manual Trigger:
#    workflow_dispatch:
#      inputs:
#        tools: "bandit,semgrep,trivy"
#        scan-scope: "changed"
#        severity-level: "MEDIUM"
#
# Note: Results are available as workflow artifacts and in the
# Security tab when integrated with GitHub Advanced Security.

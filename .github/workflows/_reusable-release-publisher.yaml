#    - Download validation
#    - Package verification
#    - Distribution preparation
#
# 2. PyPI Publication:
#    - Environment selection
#    - Package upload
#    - Publication verification
#
# 3. GitHub Release:
#    - Release creation
#    - Asset attachment
#    - Notes generation
#
# Required Inputs:
# - version: Version to release
# - artifact-name: Name of artifact to publish
# - is-prerelease: Whether this is a pre-release
#
# Required Secrets:

# - test-pypi-token: Test PyPI token (for pre-releases)
#
# Example Usage:
# 1. Production Release:
#    jobs:
#      publish:
#        uses: ./.github/workflows/_reusable-release-publisher.yaml
#        with:
#          version: "v1.0.0"
#          artifact-name: "dist-123456789"
#          is-prerelease: false

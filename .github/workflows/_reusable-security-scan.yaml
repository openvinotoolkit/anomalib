# Reusable Security Scan Workflow
#
# This reusable workflow orchestrates multiple security scanning tools to provide
# comprehensive security analysis of the codebase.
#
# Key Features:
# - Parallel security tool execution
# - Configurable tool selection
# - Comprehensive result aggregation
# - Artifact preservation
# - Customizable failure thresholds
#
# Process Stages:
# 1. Tool Selection and Configuration
# 2. Parallel Security Scans
# 3. Result Aggregation
# 4. Report Generation
#
# Required Inputs:
# - tools: Comma-separated list of tools to run
# - scan-scope: Scope of scanning
# - severity-level: Minimum severity threshold
# - fail-on-findings: Whether to fail on security findings
#
# Outputs:
# - has-findings: Boolean indicating if security issues were found
#
# Example Usage:
#   jobs:
#     security:
#       uses: ./.github/workflows/_reusable-security-scan.yaml
#       with:
#         tools: "bandit,semgrep"
#         scan-scope: "changed"
#         severity-level: "MEDIUM"
#         fail-on-findings: true
#
# Note: Different security tools may require specific permissions
# or configurations.

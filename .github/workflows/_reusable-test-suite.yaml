# Test Suite Workflow
#
# This reusable workflow executes comprehensive test suites with configurable
# parameters for different test types and environments.
#
# Key Features:
# - Parallel test execution
# - Multiple test types support
# - Coverage reporting
# - Configurable timeouts
# - Result aggregation
#
# Process Stages:
# 1. Unit Testing:
#    - Environment setup
#    - Test execution
#    - Coverage generation
#
# 2. Integration Testing:
#    - Environment preparation
#    - Test execution
#    - Result collection
#
# 3. Results Processing:
#    - Coverage reporting
#    - Result aggregation
#    - Artifact creation
#
# Required Inputs:
# - python-version: Python version for tests (default: "3.10")
# - test-type: Type of test to run (unit/integration/e2e)
# - runner: Runner to use for the tests
# - timeout: Test timeout in minutes
#
# Required Secrets:
# - codecov-token: Token for coverage reporting (optional)
#
# Outputs:
# - test-results: Path to test results artifact
#
# Example Usage:
# 1. Basic Test Run:
#    jobs:
#      test:
#        uses: ./.github/workflows/_reusable-test-suite.yaml
#        with:
#          test-type: "unit"
#
# 2. Custom Configuration:
#    jobs:
#      test:
#        uses: ./.github/workflows/_reusable-test-suite.yaml
#        with:
#          python-version: "3.11"
#          test-type: "unit"
#          timeout: 15
#        secrets:
#          codecov-token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
#
# Note: Requires properly configured pytest environment and test structure
